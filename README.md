# Google Calendar Api

# How it Works?
  - The user enters the data into the form and sends the browser a request to connect to a google account. If the browser accepts the user's request, it will open a new pop-up window to connect to the google account. When a user links a form to a google account, the form will be verified and sent to google calendar.
  - The user will be notified when the time comes (15 and 30min before meeting).
  - Aplication works with PHP, jQuery, Google Api and Google reCAPTCHA.
  
# How to use this?
  - Download file from Github and connect with your Google Api and just start php file with command "php index.php"
